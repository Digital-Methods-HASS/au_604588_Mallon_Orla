This repository contains the assignments and final exam of the Cultural Data Science course at Aarhus Univerisity, Fall 2020. 

Included here are the following: 
- Code scripts for assignment 5 and 6 
- The Final Project Script (R-Markdown file) 
- The Final Project .html
- The project liscence (MIT Liscence) 

The data for the project cannot be included in the Github repository as it is not yet a publicly available file and belongs to one of the departments within Aarhus University. As soon as the intended papers using it have been published, the data will be made public for others to use. Should this cause any issues to the proceeding of the exam, please contact me directly here or via Slack. 

Outline of the final Project: 
This project compares the Spotify Audio features of two psychedelic sub-cultures; psychedelia and neo-shamanism. It takes a 2 part form of firstly exploratory data visualisation using R-Studio and then builds 2 classifiers (Binomial Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models) to test how well the musical features can be used to predict the sub-culture the track belongs to.
