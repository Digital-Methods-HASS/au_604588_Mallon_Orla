    "Use the cv2.compareHist() function to compare the 3D color histogram for your target image to each of the other images in the corpus one-by-one.\n",
    "In particular, use chi-square distance method, like we used in class. Round this number to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "Save the results from this comparison as a single .csv file, showing the distance between your target image and each of the other images. The .csv file should show the filename for every image in your data except the target and the distance metric between that image and your target. Call your columns: filename, distance.\n",
